# XMail — Local SMTP Email Sender (No Manual .env Editing)

XMail is a lightweight local email-sending tool built with Flask.  
It works with **any SMTP provider** (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) and includes a **Setup Wizard** so users don't need to edit any config files.

On first launch, the app opens a **Setup Page** in your browser →  
You enter your SMTP details once →  
The app saves them automatically →  
Then you can send emails directly from the web UI.
