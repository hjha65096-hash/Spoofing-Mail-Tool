# Spoofing-Mail-Tool
A simple, local web-based email sender built with Flask.  It lets you send emails through any SMTP provider (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) without touching config files.  On first launch, it opens a setup page in your browser where you enter your SMTP credentials once.
